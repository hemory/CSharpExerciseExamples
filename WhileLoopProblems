While Loops

1) Write a program to keep asking for a number until you enter a negative number. At the end, print the sum of all entered numbers.

2) Write a program to ask for a name until the user enters END. Print the name each time. When you are done, print "I am done."

3) Test Average problem: (on powerpoint for while loops)

As long as there are more grades, add them to the total
Divide the total by the number of courses (each grade is a course)
Print the corresponding letter grade
Stop when the user enters a negative grade
4) Nim problem: (on powerpoint for while loops) -- this is extra, not necessary

The game Nim starts out with seven sticks on the table.
Each player takes turns picking up 1, 2 or 3 sticks and cannot pass.
Whoever picks up the last stick loses (the other player wins).
Input: The number of sticks the player is picking up
Output:
The number of sticks on the table
Who won (the player or the computer)
Other Information
Whoever leaves 5 sticks for the other player can always win if they make the right followup move:
If the other player takes 1, you pick up 3
If the other player takes 2, you pick up 2
If the other player takes 3, you pick up 1
Exact instructions:
1. Print the instructions
2. Set the number of stick at 7 and initialize other values
3. Find out if the user wants to go first or second
4. If the user goes second, have the computer take two sticks and the user goes second, have the computer take two sticks.
5. As long as there is no winner, keep playing
